# This is a backend api for https://github.com/0Armaan025/librarium/

## This is now working on gitpod and also has a lot of useless endpoints/functions that can be removed by the user/repo cloner.

## How to try it locally?
### 1.) Open the cmd/terminal/powershell and write ``git clone https://github.com/0Armaan025/python-pdf-to-image``
### 2.) Write ``cd python-pdf-to-image``
### 2.5) you can also change the endpoint on line 122 to ``http://127.0.0.1:<port>/downloads/{filename}``
### 3.) Write ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
### 4.) ``python main.py`` and book it works!

## This is it, make sure to please leave a ‚≠ê, thanks :)
